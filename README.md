This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The covid19-stats app is a single page app that provides users with up-to-date statistics about the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Users can see overall global statistics or search for specific countires.


The app can be tested at http://voiceless-manager.surge.sh
